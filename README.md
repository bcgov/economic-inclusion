economic-inclusion
============================

This code cleans and analyses the 2021 Cenus public use microdata file to test
for statistical differences between racialized and white workers in annual earnings.

This analysis is carried out separately for 26 different major occupationals groups
(based on NOC major group classification) and produces spreadsheets that are included
in the BC Data Catalogue resources for this project. For this code to run, you 
have to the spss command file to code the levels of variables. The levels are specified as their
text names in this code (see codebook) rather than numerical values. 

See https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/98m0001x/2023001/cen21_ind_98m0001x_part_rec21.zip 
for the data download and including the spss command file and
codebook that specifies text and numerical values.
